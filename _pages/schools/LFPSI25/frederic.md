**Lecturer:** [Frédéric Blanqui](https://blanqui.gitlabpages.inria.fr/)

In this course, we are going to see how dependent types and rewriting can be used to represent proofs, so as to facilitate their exchange between provers. In practical sessions, we will learn how to use the interactive logical framework [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) to define functions and types using rewriting, and represent the proofs of various logical systems. Finally, we will see how to try to automatically check some important properties of the rewrite systems one can define in Lambdapi.

Outline:

1. Introduction to proof systems interoperability, λ-calculus and
   dependent types

    (To prepare the practical session tomorrow, please install Lambdapi on your machine.)

2. Introduction to λΠ/R: pure type systems, rewriting, introduction to the Lambdapi proof assistant, practical session on Lambdapi

3. Encoding logics in λΠ/R: first-order logic, polymorphism, higher-order logic, pure type systems, …

4. Properties of λΠ/R: decidability of type-checking, subject-reduction, confluence, termination, dependencies between these properties
