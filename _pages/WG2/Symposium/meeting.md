**Objective:** The aim of this meeting series is to bring together researchers working on the topics of [working group 2 of EuroProofNet](https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2/). Our work focuses on two topics: Our first aim is to work and improve automated theorem provers. Our second aim is to make them correct by improving proof logging -- both in an attempt to produce short proofs but also to work on proof formats that support many features instead of having one format for each required feature. Proof logging is an important topic, as it makes it possible to check the work of a solver without trusting it. Our third aim is to translate proofs via the Dedukti proof system.

The program will be composed of talks and sessions to work alone or in small groups on the development of tools for automated theorem proving and proofs (in particular Dedukti proofs), taking advantage of the participation of experts on Dedukti, formula and proof exchange standards, and theorem provers and solvers, and to make progress on EuroProofNet objectives and deliverables.

<!--
**Objectives/Deliverables:**
  - D10. Release of software for translating proofs coming from important proof systems based on set theory like Mizar, Atelier B or TLAPS to Dedukti and back.
