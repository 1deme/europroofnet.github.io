# Meeting 4

## Situation Summary by Frédéric

See the slides of the Chair

-   Slow evolution in the number of people
-   Maybe record more talks next talks, only few new this year?
-   Many publications needed for the final version of the report
-   Budget: STSMs and ICTGs largest expense. Sometimes less money spent
    than planned, so more events could be funded.  Now full budget spent.
-   Reimbursement: before september only LOS missing. Since September,
    not reimbursed yet (not checked yet / not fully reimbursed
    yet). Should be done in the coming month.

## STSMs and ITCGs by Simona Prokic
